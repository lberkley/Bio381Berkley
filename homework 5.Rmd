### Question 1

```{r}
# Assign to the variable n_dims a single random integer between 3 and 10.
n_dims <- floor(runif(1, min = 3, max = 10))
print(n_dims)

# Create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims^2.
next_vector <- seq(1:n_dims^2)
print(next_vector)

# Use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values.
sample(next_vector)

# Create a square matrix with these elements.
my_matrix <- matrix(next_vector, nrow = n_dims, byrow = TRUE)

# Print out the matrix.
print(my_matrix)

# Find a function in r to transpose the matrix. I found the function transpose which is t(matrix).
transposed_matrix <- t(my_matrix)

# Print it out again and note how it has changed.
print(transposed_matrix)

# Calculate the sum and the mean of the elements in the first row and the last row.

## Sum
### First row
sum(transposed_matrix[1,])
### Last row
sum(transposed_matrix[n_dims,])

## Mean
### First row
mean(transposed_matrix[1,])
### Last row
mean(transposed_matrix[n_dims,])

# Read about the eigen() function and use it on your matrix.
eigen_lists <- eigen(transposed_matrix, only.values = FALSE, EISPACK = FALSE)
print(eigen_lists)

# Look carefully at the elements of $values and $vectors. What kind of numbers are these?
## ???

# Dig in with the typeof() function to figure out their type.
typeof(eigen_lists $ values)
typeof(eigen_lists $ vectors)

# If have set your code up properly, you should be able to re-run it and create a matrix of different size because n_dims will change.
## Yep!
```

### Question 2

```{r}
# Create a list with the following named elements:
# my_matrix, which is a 4 x 4 matrix filled with random uniform values
# my_logical which is a 100-element vector of TRUE or FALSE values. Do this efficiently by setting up a vector of random values and then applying an inequality to it.
# my_letters, which is a 26-element vector of all the lower-case letters in random order.

my_matrix <- matrix(runif(16), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
print(my_new_matrix)

my_logical <- runif(100) < 0.5
print(my_logical)

my_letters <- sample(letters[seq(1:26)])
print(my_letters)

my_list <- c(my_matrix, my_logical, my_letters)
print(my_list)
```
