1. This is the first question text:   
```
First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124
```

Here's what I did in BB edit to turn this text into a `.csv` :   
```
FIND: (\h+)
REPLACE: ,
```

Here's the result:   
```
First,String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More,Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124
```   

`(\h+)` looks for horizontal white space, thus selecting the spaces between the words that I want to change. `,` replaces those spaces with a comma.
