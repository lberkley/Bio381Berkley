### Question 1

This is the first question text:   
```
First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124
```

Here's what I did in BB edit to turn this text into a `.csv` :   
```
FIND: (\h+)
REPLACE: ,
```

Here's the result:   
```
First,String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More,Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124
```   

`(\h+)` looks for horizontal white space, thus selecting the spaces between the words that I want to change. `,` replaces those spaces with a comma.

### Question 2

This is the second question text:
```   
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr
```   

Here's what I did in BB edit:
```
FIND: (\w*),\s(\w*),\s(\w.*)
REPLACE: \1 \2 (\3)
```

Here's the result:
```
Ballif Bryan (University of Vermont)
Ellison Aaron (Harvard Forest)
Record Sydne (Bryn Mawr)
```

I selected the individual words, so that I could delete the commas after the first and second word, then add parentheses to the rest of the words.

### Question 3

This is the text for question 3:
```
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3
```

Here's what I did in BB edit:
```
FIND: (\.mp3\s)
REPLACE: \1\n
```

Here's what I got:
```
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 
0004 Walking Cane.mp3
```

`(\.mp3\s)` selects the ".mp3" at the end of each line AND the space that follows it. When I replace that with `\1\n` it enters a line break after the ".mp3" and deletes the space.

### Question 4

Continuing with the edited text from Question 3...

Here's what I did in BB edit:
```
FIND:(\d{4})(\s)(.*\w+)(\.mp3)
REPLACE:\3_\1\4
```

Here's the result:
```
Georgia Horseshoe_0001.mp3 
Billy In The Lowground_0002.mp3 
Cherokee Shuffle_0003.mp3
Walking Cane_0004.mp3
```

I separated the text into four captures: 1) the four-digit number, 2) the space after the four-digit number, 3) the song title, and 4) the ".mp3". I could easily move the four-digit number to after the song title, insert a "_" between the song title and four-digit number, and delete the unwanted space (by replacing it with nothing).

### Question 5

This is the text for Question 5:
```
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55
```

Here's what I did in BB edit:
```
